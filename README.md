## Hello 🍉

🍏 I am Dace, software developer with a background in accounting and finance, located in Riga. I enjoy being challenged for self-development.

🍒 Currently I am continuously evolving my professional skills in front-end && back-end web 
application development utilizing a wide range of technologies, including PHP, MySQL, Laravel, 
Unit & Integration testing, MVC, HTML & CSS.

🍋 These are my favourite fruits, and I believe that learning something new EVERY day for at least 15 minutes can make you a better person.
