## Hi

I am Dace, software developer with a background in accounting and finance. I enjoy being challenged for self-development.

I am continuously evolving my professional skills in front-end && back-end web 
application development utilizing a wide range of technologies, including PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, Laravel, MVC, HTML & CSS.

üçã I believe that learning something new EVERY day for at least 15 minutes can make you a better person. 

### My Work from time when I started to code in 2022:
